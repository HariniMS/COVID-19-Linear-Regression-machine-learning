# COVID-19-Linear-Regression-machine-learning
 Predicting COVID-19 with machine learning.  In this project , we are predicting COVID-19 cases in "India" location using Linear Regression
 
its prediciting only 55192 cases on 737573 date(28th may 2020) in india, which is wrong prediction , because on 737569 (2020-05-24) it's showing 131868 cases and for the next 4 days(28th may 2020) it's showing very less cases.

So we can use other algorithms to get good accuracy and gives good predictions
